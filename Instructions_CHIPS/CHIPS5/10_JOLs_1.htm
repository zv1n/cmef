Now that you have had an opportunity to study each of the word pairs we<br>
would like to know how likely you think you will be able to correctly<br>
recall each of the characters on a recall test.<br><br>

You will be presented with each of the Chinese characters and asked to<br>
predict on a scale of 0% to 100% how likely you think you will be able <br>
to correctly recall the character on a recall test (with 0% meaning <br>
you think there is no chance of recalling the English equivilent and <br>
100% meaning you are 100 percent sure that you will be able to recall<br>
the English equivilent). Please hit "Continue" to begin. <br>
