
In the first study phase you will be given the opportunity to view 3 different 2 x 3
grids and select the Chinese words for which you would like to see the English
equivalents.  Each 2 x 3 grid will contain the Chinese words from Chinese-English
vocabulary pairs.  A sample study grid appears below.  If this grid were active, then
you could click on one of the Chinese characters to view its English equivalent.
