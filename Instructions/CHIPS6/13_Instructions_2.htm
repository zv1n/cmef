You have completed Trial 1. Trial 2 will now begin.<br>  
<br>
In this trial you will be given a second opportunity to study the Chinese<br>
characters.  As in Trial 1 you will be given 30 seconds per grid to study the Chinese characters with<br>
their English equivalents.  After you have finished studying these words, you will <br>
be asked to predict your ability to recall the English equivalents and will then be<br> presented with a second recall test over all 36 characters.  Before you begin studying<br> items we would like you to predict how many items you will learn in Trial 2. <br> Please click 
"Continue" to provide your prediction. <br>
