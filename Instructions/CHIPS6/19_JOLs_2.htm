Now that you have had an opportunity to study each of the word pairs again we would<br>
like to know how likely you believe that you will be able to recall the English<br>
translation when presented with the Chinese character. <br><br>


As in Trial 1, you will be asked to make this judgment of learning using ANY NUMBER from <br>
0 through 100.  Typing the number 0 indicates you will definitely not recall<br> 
the English translation when prompted with the Chinese character.  Typing the number 100 means that you will definitely be able to correctly recall the English translation.  For all <br>
judgments, remember that they pertain to the likelihood that you will be able to <br>
recall the English translation when prompted with the Chinese character in about <br>
10 minutes from the judgment.  Please hit "Continue" to begin.<br>
