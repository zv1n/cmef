In each study phase you will be able to decide which items to study.<br> 
Remember that you will have 30 seconds per grid to study items. If you click<br>
on a Chinese character a new screen will open containing the Chinese character<br>
and its English equivalent.  A clock will begin counting down until you indicate<br>
you are finished studying that item.  You may select or reselect items to study<br>
until time runs out.  If you finish studying items before time runs out you can <br>
move on to the next grid. Your goal is to prepare for the upcoming recall test in<br>
which you will be presented with each Chinese character and asked to type what it<br> 
means in English.  You will then receive instructions for Trial 2. We have provided<br> 
an example word pair below so that you know what to expect during the study phase.<br>

This is an example of how these word pairs will look.<br>
