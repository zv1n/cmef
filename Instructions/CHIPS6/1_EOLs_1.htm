In this task you will be asked to study Chinese-English vocabulary word pairs.  Before<br>
you begin studying the word pairs, we would like to know how easy or difficult you think<br>
each Chinese word will be for you to learn.  You will make your ratings using the <br>
following scale:<br><br>


<br></font></tr></td>
<td><tr align="center">
<br>
<img src="Images/RatingScale.jpg">
<br>
</tr></td>
<td><tr><br>
<font size="+1">


If you think the word will be easy for you to learn, then you will select a number on<br>
the left side of the scale.  If you think the word will be hard for you to learn, you<br>
will select a number on the right side of the scale.  If you think the word will be<br>
somewhere between easy and hard, then you will select a number in the middle of the<br>
scale.  You will provide your rating by clicking the radio button that corresponds  <br>
with your selection.  Please click "Continue" to view a sample screen so that you <br>
may become familiar with the format.<br>
