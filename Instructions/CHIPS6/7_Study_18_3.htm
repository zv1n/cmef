After you indicate you are finished studying the selected vocabulary pair (e.g., by<br>
clicking on the "Close" button) the countdown clock will stop and the grid will <br>
automatically reappear and you will have the opportunity to select other words <br>
to study.<br><br>

You may select unstudied words or restudy previously selected words as long as time <br>
remains on the clock.  If you have studied all the words within the grid that you <br>
wish to study and time still remains on the clock, you can indicate that you wish<br>
to end the restudy phase by clicking the "Continue" button. <br><br>

Please click "Continue" to begin the study phase.<br>
