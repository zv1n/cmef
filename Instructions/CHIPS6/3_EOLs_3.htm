Each Chinese word will appear, one at a time and you will be asked to provide <br>
an ease of learning judgment for that word using the 1-9 scale that appeared <br>
on the previous screen.  This process will continue until you have  provided <br>
an ease of learning judgment for every word.  If you have questions about <br>
this procedure, please notify the experimenter now.  If at anytime during <br>
this experiment an image does not display, simply click the "Refresh" button <br>
in the bottom left corner to refresh the screen. Please click "Continue" to <br>
begin providing your judgments.<br>
