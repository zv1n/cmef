Now you will be asked to try to recall the vocabulary pairs.  In each screen we will<br>

English equivalent.  After you have typed your response please press "Enter" to move<br>
on to the next word.  If you cannot recall the English equivalent you can simply hit<br>
any letter on the keyboard before clicking "Continue".  Please click "Continue" to<br>
