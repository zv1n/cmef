In this task you will be asked to study Chinese-English vocabulary pairs.  Before you
begin studying the vocabulary pairs, we would like to know how easy you think each 
Chinese word will be for you to learn.  You will make your ratings using the
following scale:

If you think the word will be easy for you to learn, then you will select a number on
the left side of the scale.  If you think the word will be hard for you to learn, you
will select a number on the right side of the scale.  If you think the word will be
somewhere between easy and hard, then you will select a number in the middle of the
scale.  You will provide your rating by clicking the radio button that corresponds  
with your selection.  Please click "Continue" to view a sample screen so that you 
may become familiar with the format.
