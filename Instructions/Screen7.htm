In the first study phase you will be given the opportunity to view 2 different 3 x 3<br>
grids and select the Chinese words for which you would like to see the English<br>
equivalents.  Each 3 x 3 grid will contain the Chinese words from Chinese-English<br>
vocabulary pairs.  A sample study grid appears below.  If this grid were active, then<br>
you could click on one of the Chinese characters to view its English equivalent.<br>

Because the words vary in difficulty we are providing information along with each <br>
Chinese character that tells you whether prior participants found the word easy, <br>
moderately difficult, or hard to learn and recall.  An <bold>'E'</bold> will appear by easy <br> 
Chinese characters, an <bold>'M'</bold> by moderately difficult characters, and an <bold>'H'</bold> by items <br> 
participants found hard to recall.  In addition, by each Chinese character you will <br>
see a number, which reflects how many points you can earn by learning and correctly <br>
recalling the English equivalent when later presented with the Chinese character <br>
on the recall test.<br>
