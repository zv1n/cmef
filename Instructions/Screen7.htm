
In the first study phase you will be given the opportunity to view 2 different 3 x 3
grids and select the Chinese words for which you would like to see the English
equivalents.  Each 3 x 3 grid will contain the Chinese words from Chinese-English
vocabulary pairs.  A sample study grid appears below.  If this grid were active, then
you could click on one of the Chinese characters to view its English equivalent.

Because the words vary in difficulty we are providing information along with each 
Chinese character that tells you whether prior participants found the word easy, 
moderately difficult, or hard to learn and recall.  An “E” will appear by easy 
Chinese characters, an “M” by moderately difficult characters, and an “H” by items 
participants found hard to recall.  In addition, by each Chinese character you will 
see a number, which reflects how many points you can earn by learning and correctly 
recalling the English equivalent when later presented with the Chinese character 
on the recall test.  

Please click "Continue" once you have had a chance to review the sample grid.
