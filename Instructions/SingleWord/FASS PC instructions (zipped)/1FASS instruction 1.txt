In this task you will be asked to try to remember word pairs presented in different fonts.<br>
After you study each word pair, you will be asked to estimate your ability on a scale<br> 
(0 to 100) to remember the word pairs on a later recall test.For example, you may be<br> 
presented with the word pair "clown - spoon" and then, after 5 seconds of study time asked,<br>
 "On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you to remember this word pair on a later recall<br>
test?" Later, on the recall task you will shown the first word, "clown - ?" You will then type in<br>
the missing word, "spoon."<br> 
<br>
There will be two trials each containing 60 word pairs. At the end of each trial<br>
you will be given a word pair recall test.<br>
