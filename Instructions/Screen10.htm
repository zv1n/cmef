After you indicate you are finished studying the selected vocabulary pair (e.g., by <br> 
clicking on the "Finished Studying" button) the countdown clock will stop and the <br> 
grid will automatically reappear and you will have the opportunity to select other <br> 
items to study.  To allow you to easily keep track of which items you have studied <br> 
within a grid, once an item has been selected for study it will turn red while <br> 
unselected items will remain green. <br>  
<br>
You may select unstudied (green) items or restudy previously selected (red) items <br>  
as long as time remains on the clock.  If you have studied all the items within a <br> 
grid that you wish to study and time still remains on the clock, you can indicate <br> 
that you wish to move on to the next grid by clicking the "Finished studying this <br> 
grid" button at the bottom of the grid screen.<br>
<br>
Clicking this button will automatically bring up the next grid and restart the <br> 
countdown clock.  Once time has elapsed or you indicate you have finished studying <br> 
both the grids you will be asked to try and recall the English equivalents for each <br> 
of the 18 Chinese words.<br>
