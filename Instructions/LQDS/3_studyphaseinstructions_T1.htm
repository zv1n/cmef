We will now begin the Trial 1 study phase. Once you click continue below, you will<br>
be presented with 60 words. Each word will be presented for 5 seconds and then you<br>
will be asked to predict how likely you will be able to remember the word on a later <br>
recall test. The scale will be presented from 0 (no likelihood of recall) to<br>
100 (likelihood of recall is certain).<br><br>
Please click continue to begin the study phase of Trial 1.<br>
