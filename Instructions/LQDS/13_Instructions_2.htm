Now that you have completed the study phase for Trial 2, you are ready to begin the Trial 2 <br>
recall test. Once you begin the test you should type each word you can remember, putting only <br>
one word per box.  Please spend approximately 5 minutes trying to recall as many words as <br>
possible.  Once you have recalled all the words you can remember, you will have to click the <br>
continue button until you see a screen with text appear.  <br><br>


If you have questions please quietly notify the experimenter now. Otherwise, please click <br>
"Continue" to begin the recall test.<br><br>
