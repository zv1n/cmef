Now that you have completed the study phase for Trial 1, you are ready to begin the Trial 1 <br>
recall test. Once you begin the test you should type each word you remember.  You will type <br>
one word, then press Continue to type the next word. Avoid typing more than one word in each <br>
blank. Please spend about 5 minutes trying to recall as many words as possible.  Once you feel <br>
that you have recalled every word that you can remember, you will have to click on the continue <br>
button multiple times (once for each of the 60 words you could not recall) until you see a screen<br>
with text appear. <br><br>


Once you complete the Trial 1 recall test, you will see instructions for Trial 2. If you have questions <br>
please quietly notify the experimenter now. Otherwise, please click "Continue" to begin the recall test.<br><br>
