In this task you will be asked to try to remember 60 different words presented in<br>
each of 2 study-test trials. All words will be presented visually on the screen <br>
as well as auditorially via headphones. Some of the words will be presented at a <br>
softer volume while other words will be presented at a higher volume. You will be <br>
given an opportunity to determine a comfortable volume level before the actual task begins.<br><br>
 
Some of the words you will see and hear represent items typically thought of as loud <br>
(e.g., weedeater), while other words represent items typically thought of as quiet <br>
(e.g., slippers). Other items are neutral with regard to sound. That is they do not have <br>
any sound qualities associated with them (e.g., thermometer).<br> <br>

Each word will be shown and played once and you will have 5 seconds to try memorize it. After you study <br>
each word you will be asked to predict how likely you think it is that you will be able to <br>
remember that word on the upcoming recall test. You will provide these judgments using any <br>
number between 0-100, where 0 = no confidence and 100 = complete confidence you'll be able to<br>
recall a particular word.<br><br>

Once you have studied and provided judgments for each of the 60 items, you will be asked<br>
to type all the words you can remember during the recall test. You will then complete a<br>
second study-test trial in which you will study a second set of 60 words.<br> <br>

screen; however, be sure to read the instruction screens thoroughly before continuing<br>
because you will be unable to go back. <br>
