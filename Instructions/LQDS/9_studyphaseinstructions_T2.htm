We will now begin the Trial 2 study phase. As in Trial 1 you will be asked to study <br>
60 new words, each for 5 seconds. The words will again either represent items thought of <br>
as loud or quiet, or that have no sound qualities. <br><br>

As before, after you study each word you will be asked to predict how likely you will be to <br>
remember the word on the Trial 2 recall test. <br><br>
Remember that you can type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100. Typing 0 means there is no likelihood<br>
that you will recall the word, and 100 means you will definitely recall the word on the Trial 2 <br>
recall test.<br><br>
