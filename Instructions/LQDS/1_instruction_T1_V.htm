In this task you will be asked to try to remember 60 different words presented in<br>
each of 2 study-test trials. Some words represent items typically thought of as loud<br>
(e.g., weedeater), while other words represent items typically thought of as quiet<br>
(e.g., slippers). Other items are neutral with regard to sound. That is they do not<br>
have any sound qualities associated with them (e.g., thermometer).<br><br>

Each word will be presented for 5 seconds on the screen, during which time you should<br>
try to memorize it. After you study each word you will be asked to predict how likely you<br>
think it is that you will be able to remember that word on the upcoming recall test.<br>
You will provide these judgments using any number between 0-100, where 0 = no confidence<br>
and 100 = complete confidence you'll be able to recall a particular word.<br><br>

Once you have studied and provided judgments for each of the 60 items, you will be asked<br>
to type all the words you can remember during the recall test. You will then complete a<br>
second study-test trial in which you will study a second set of 60 words.<br> <br>

To advance to the next screen, please click on the word "continue" at the bottom of the<br> 
screen; however, be sure to read the instruction screens thoroughly before continuing<br>
because you will be unable to go back. <br>
