
After you indicate you are finished studying the selected vocabulary pair (e.g., by
clicking on the "Finished Studying" button) the countdown clock will stop and the
grid will automatically reappear and you will have the opportunity to select other
items to study.  To allow you to easily keep track of which items you have studied
within a grid, once an item has been selected for study it will turn red while
unselected items will remain green.  

You may select unstudied (green) items or restudy previously selected (red) items 
as long as time remains on the clock.  If you have studied all the items within a 
grid that you wish to study and time still remains on the clock, you can indicate 
that you wish to move on to the next grid by clicking the "Finished studying this 
grid" button at the bottom of the grid screen.

Clicking this button will automatically bring up the next grid and restart the
countdown clock.  Once time has elapsed or you indicate you have finished studying
both the grids you will be asked to try and recall the English equivalents for each
of the 18 Chinese words.
