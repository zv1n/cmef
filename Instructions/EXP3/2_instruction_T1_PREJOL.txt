After you are told whether the word pair is related/unrelated and in large/small <br>
font, you will be asked to estimate how likely you will be to remember the word pair<br>
on a later recall test. You will provide your estimate using a 0 to 100 scale where <br>
0 = no confidence and 100 = complete confidence that you will be able to recall the <br>
second word of the pair when shown the first word of each pair. <br>
<br>
For example, you may be told that the upcoming word pair is related and in small font.<br>
You would then be asked to type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate how confident<br>
you are that you will be able to learn and recall the word pair on the recall task. <br>
You will then be shown the word pair such as "table - chair" and given 5 seconds to study it. <br>
After time is up, you would be told about the next word pair and whether it is related/unrelated<br>
and in large/small font, provide your judgment, and study the pair.  This process will repeat <br>
until you have studied all 60 word pairs in Trial 1.  You will then begin the recall test where <br>
you will be shown the first word, "table - ?" and asked to type the second word of the pair, "chair."<br> 
Once you have attempted to recall all 60 pairs, you will begin a final trial that uses different <br>
word pairs, but follows the same steps as Trial 1.<br>
