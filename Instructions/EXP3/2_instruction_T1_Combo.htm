After you are told whether the word pair is related/unrelated and in large/small <br>
font, you will be asked to estimate how likely you will be to learn and remember the word <br>
pair on a later recall test both BEFORE and AFTER you study the word pair. <br>
<br>
For example, you may be told that the upcoming word pair is related and in small font.<br>
You would then be asked to type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate how confident<br>
you are that you will be able to learn and recall the word pair on the recall task. <br>
You will then be shown the word pair such as "table - chair" and given 5 seconds to study it. <br>
After the 5 seconds have elapsed you will be asked to provide another judgment using the same <br>
0 to 100 scale to indicate your confidence level. <br><br>
After providing your judgment, you would be told about the next word pair and whether it is <br>
related/unrelated and in large/small font. You would then provide your prestudy judgment, <br>
study the word pair, and provide your poststudy judgment. This process will repeat until you <br>
have studied all 60 word pairs in Trial 1. You will then begin the recall test where you will <br>
be shown the first word of each pair, "table - ?" and asked to type the second word of the pair,<br>
"chair." Once you have attempted to recall all 60 pairs, you will begin a final <br>
trial that uses different word pairs, but follows the same steps as Trial 1.<br>
