After you are told whether the word pair is related/unrelated and in large/small <br>
font, you will be given 5 seconds to study the word pair. You will then be asked to <br>
estimate how likely you will be to remember the word pair on a later recall test <br>
using a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no confidence and 100 = complete confidence that you <br>
 will be able to recall the second word of the pair when shown the first word of each pair. <br>
<br>
For example, you may be told that the upcoming word pair is related and in small font.<br>
Then, after 5 seconds of study time asked, "On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you <br>
to remember the second word of the pair when shown the first word on the upcoming recall test?"<br>
You will be asked to type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate your confidence level. After<br>
you provide your judgment, you would be told about the next word pair and whether it is <br>
related/unrelated and in large/small font, study the word pair, and provide your judgment. This <br>
process will repeat until you have studied all 60 word pairs in Trial 1. You will then begin the <br>
recall test where you will be shown the first word, "table - ?" and asked to type the second <br>
word of the pair, "chair." Once you have attempted to recall all 60 pairs, you will begin a final <br>
trial that uses different word pairs, but follows the same steps as Trial 1.<br> <br>

If you have any questions at this time, please raise your hand quietly to alert the research <br>
assistant. If you are ready to begin then please click on the word "continue" at the bottom of the<br> 
screen. <br>
