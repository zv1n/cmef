In this task you will be asked to try to learn related (e.g., table - chair) <br>
and unrelated (e.g., paperclip - yarn) word pairs presented in either large <br>
48 point font or small 18 point font.<br><br>
You will be presented with 60 different word pairs in each of two trials and will have <br>
5 seconds to study each pair. You will be informed whether the word pair is <br>
related/unrelated and in large/small font prior to studying each pair. You will also be <br> 
asked to predict the likelihood of you recalling each word pair.<br><BR>

To advance to the next screen, please click on the word "continue" at the bottom of the<br> 
screen; however, be sure to read the instruction screens thoroughly before continuing<br>
because you will be unable to go back. <br><br>
