Now that you have completed the study phase for Trial 1, you are ready to begin the Trial 1 <br>
recall test. Once you begin the test you will be shown the first word of each pair (e.g., paperclip - ?)<br>
and will type the second word that was matched with it during the study phase (e.g., yarn). <br><br>

If you are unable to remember the missing word you should click "Continue" to move on to the next word. <br>
Once you complete the Trial 1 recall test, you will see instructions for Trial 2. If you have questions <br>
please quietly notify the experimenter now. Otherwise, please click "Continue" to begin the recall test.<br><br>
