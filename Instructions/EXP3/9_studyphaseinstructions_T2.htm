We will now begin the Trial 2 study phase. As in Trial 1 you will be asked to study <br>
60 new word pairs, each for 5 seconds. As in Trial 1 the word pairs will either contain <br>
small or large items presented in either small or large fonts such that the pairs will <br>
either be matched (small items in small fonts or large items in large fonts) or mismatched <br>
(small items in large fonts or large items in small fonts). As before, after you study each <br>
 word pair you will be asked to predict how likely you will be to remember the word pair <br>
on the Trial 2 recall test. <br><br>
Remember that you can type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100. Typing 0 means there is no likelihood <br>
that you will recall the second word when presented with the first, and 100 means you will <br>
definitely recall the word pair on the Trial 2 recall test.<br><br>
