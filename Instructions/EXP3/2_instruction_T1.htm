After you study each word pair, you will be asked to estimate how likely you will be to remember <br>
the word pairs on a later recall test using a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no confidence and <br>
100 = complete confidence that you will be able to recall the second word of the pair when <br> 
shown the first word of each pair. <br>
<br>
For example, you may be presented with a word pair such as "paperclip - yarn" and then, after <br>
5 seconds of study time asked, "On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you to remember the second <br>
word of the pair when shown the first word on the upcoming recall test?" You will be asked to type <br>
ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate your confidence level. Later, on the recall task you will <br>
be shown the first word, "paperclip - ?" and asked to type the second word of the pair, "yarn."<br> 
<br>
There will be two trials each containing 60 word pairs. At the end of each trial<br>
you will be given a word pair recall test.<br>
<br>
