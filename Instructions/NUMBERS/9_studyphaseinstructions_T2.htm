We will now begin the Trial 2 study phase. As in Trial 1 you will be asked to study <br>
32 new numbers, each for 5 seconds. The numbers will again be presented in either small<br>
or large fonts. As before, after you study each number you will be asked to predict how <br>
likely you will be to remember the number on the Trial 2 recognition test. <br><br>
Remember that you can type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100. Typing 0 means there is no<br>
likelihood that you will recognize the number, and 100 means you will definitely recognize<br>
the number on the Trial 2 recognition test.<br><br>
