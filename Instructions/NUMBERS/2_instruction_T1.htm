As noted, after you study each number, you will be asked to estimate how likely you will be <br>
to remember the number on a later recognition test using a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no confidence<br>
and 100 = complete confidence that you will be able to recognize the number.<br>
<br>
For example, you may be presented with a number such as "922" and then, after 5 seconds of <br>
study time asked, "On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you to remember the number on the <br>
upcoming recognition test?" You will be asked to type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate<br>
your confidence level. Later, on the recognition task you will be shown 64 numbers and asked to <br>
indicate for each number whether it is one you studied during the study phase or not.<br>

<br>
There will be two trials each containing 32 numbers to study. At the end of each trial<br>
you will be given a recognition test.<br>
<br>
