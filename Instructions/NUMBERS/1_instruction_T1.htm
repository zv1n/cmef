In this task you will be asked to try to remember numbers presented in different fonts.<br>
You will be asked to complete two study-test trials. In each trial you will be shown 32<br>
different numbers, one at a time, each for 5 seconds. Your goal is to memorize these numbers<br>
for an upcoming recognition test. After you study each number you will be asked to rate how <br>
likely you believe you will be to recognize the number on the recognition test. <br><br>

During the recognition test you will be shown 64 numbers, half of which will be new and half <br>
of which you will have studied.  You will be asked to indicate whether you studied the number or not.  <br> <br>
