Now that you have completed the study phase for Trial 2, you are ready to begin the Trial 2 <br>
recognition test. Once you begin the test you will be shown 64 numbers, one at a time, and <br>
asked to indicate whether the number is one you studied during the Trial 2 study phase or not. <br><br>

If the number is one you studied, please press O for old.  If it is a new number that you did <br>
not see during the study phase, please press N for new. After you provide each old/new judgment<br>
you will click on the continue button to bring up the next number. <br><br>


If you have questions please quietly notify the experimenter now. Otherwise, please click "Continue" <br>
to begin the recognition test.<br><br>
