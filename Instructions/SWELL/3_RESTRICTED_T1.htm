We will now begin the Trial 1 study phase. Once you click continue below, you will<br>
be presented with 5 grids. You will have 20 seconds per grid to study items within<br>
the grid. Once you've seen all 5 grids you will be asked to predict how likely you <br>
will be able to remember the word pairs on a later recall test. The scale will be <br>
presented from 0 (no likelihood of recall) to 100 (likelihood of recall is certain).<br><br>
Please click continue to begin the study phase of Trial 1.<br>
