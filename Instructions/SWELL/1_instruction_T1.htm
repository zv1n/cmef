In this task you will be asked to try to learn Swahili-English vocabulary pairs (e.g., sala - prayer).<br>
Some word pairs will be easier to learn than others, but you can expect equal numbers of easy, <br>
moderately difficult, and difficult word pairs. Each word pair will be assigned a point value, which<br>
indicates how many points you can earn by learning and later correctly recalling that pair on the recall<br>
test.<br> <br>

YOUR GOAL IS TO EARN AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE IN THIS TASK. <br><br>
