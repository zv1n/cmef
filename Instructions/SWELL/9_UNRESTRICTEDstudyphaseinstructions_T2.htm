We will now begin the Trial 2 study phase in which you will be given the opportunity to<br>
study the SAME Swahili-English word pairs that you studied in Trial 1.  As in Trial 1 <br>
there will be five different grids, each containing 2 easy, 2 medium, and 2 difficult pairs.<br>
The word pairs will again be labeled so that you know whether the pair is easy (E), medium (M),<br> 
or difficult (D) and how many points each pair is worth if you learn it.  As before, YOUR GOAL <br>
IS TO EARN AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE by memorizing and later correctly recalling the <br>
English equivalents when shown each Swahili term on the recall test.<br><br>

You will again be allotted 120 seconds per grid to study items. The items within each grid <br>
will again change locations after you select an item, but studied items will be red and items<br>
that have not been studied yet will be green to allow you to easily identify which items you<br>
have studied.  Once you complete the Trial 2 study phase, you will be asked to predict how <br>
likely you will be to remember each word pair before you begin the final recall test. <br><br>

If you have questions, please quietly notify the experimenter now.  Otherwise, please press<br>
Continue to begin the Trial 2 study phase.<br>
