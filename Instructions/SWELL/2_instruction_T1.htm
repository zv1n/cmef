As noted, YOUR GOAL IN THIS TASK IS TO EARN AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE. To do this <br>
you will select items to study and memorize.  You will be shown 5 different grids <br>
in each of two trials.  Each grid will contain 2 easy, 2 medium, and 2 difficult <br>
word pairs.  So you know each pair's difficulty level, they will be labeled either <br>
E for easy, M for medium (moderately difficult) items, or D for difficult. You <br>
will only see the Swahili portion of each vocabulary pair (e.g., sala - ), and <br>
will have to click on that item in order to see the English equivalent. <br><br>


Please click on the word "continue" at the bottom of the screen. <br>
