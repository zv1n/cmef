As noted, YOUR GOAL IN THIS TASK IS TO EARN AS MANY POINTS AS <br> 
POSSIBLE. To do this you will select items to study and memorize.<br>
You will be shown 5 different grids in each of two trials.  Each <br>
grid will contain 2 easy, 2 medium, and 2 difficult vocabulary pairs. <br>
So you know each pair's difficulty level, they will be labeled either <br>
easy, medium (moderately difficult), or difficult. <br><br>

You will only see the Swahili portion of each vocabulary pair <br>
(e.g., sala - ), and will have to click on that item in order to <br>
see the English equivalent. <br><br>


Please click on the word "Continue" at the bottom of the screen. <br>
