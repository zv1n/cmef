Once you click on an item, a new window will open showing the entire word pair <br>
(e.g., sala - prayer).  A clock will begin counting down from 120 seconds to tell <br>
you how much time you have left to study items within that grid. Once you finish <br>
studying an item, click continue to return to the grid and stop the clock.  <br><br>

Note that after each selection, the word pairs will appear in new locations. <br>
However, studied items will turn red while items you haven't studied yet will be <br>
green to allow you to easily differentiate studied from non-studied items. <br><br>

You may study items as many times as you would like as long as time remains on <br>
the clock. Once time has elapsed or you have finished studying all the items you <br>
would like to study, a new grid will appear and a new 120 second clock will start <br>
again for that new grid. This will repeat until you have studied all 5 grids.<br><br>
