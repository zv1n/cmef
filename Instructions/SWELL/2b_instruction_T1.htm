After you have studied items from all 5 grids in Trial 1, you will be asked to estimate <br>
how likely you will be to remember the word pairs on a later recall test using a 0 to 100<br>
scale where 0 = no confidence and 100 = complete confidence that you will be able to recall<br>
the English portion of each pair (e.g., prayer) when shown the Swahili word (e.g., sala).<br>
<br>
For example, you may be presented with the Swahili word such as "sala" and then asked <br>
"On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you to remember the English equivalent on the<br>
upcoming recall test?" You will be asked to type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate <br>
your confidence level. Later, on the recall task you will be shown each Swahili word and <br>
asked to type the English equivalent.<br>
<br>
There will be two trials, each containing 30 Swahili-English vocabulary pairs to study within<br>
the allotted time. At the end of each trial you will be given a recall test.<br>
<br>
Remember, YOUR GOAL IS TO EARN AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE.<br><br>

If you have any questions at this time, please raise your hand quietly to alert the research <br>
