You will have 45 seconds total to study the words within a grid.  Only by clicking on<br>
a Chinese word will you be able to view the English equivalent for that word.  Once<br>
you select a word to study, a new screen will appear that contains the complete<br>
Chinese-English vocabulary pair as well as a countdown clock indicating how much time<br>
you have left to study words within the grid.  This clock will continue to count down<br>
until you either indicate you are finished studying the word by clicking the <br>
"Close" button or time runs out.<br>
<br>
Please click "Continue" to view a sample study screen.<br>
