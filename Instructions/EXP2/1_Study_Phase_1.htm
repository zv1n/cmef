Thank you for providing your guess for what the English equivalent is for each <br>
of the Spanish words. <br>
<br>
You are now ready to begin the study portion of today’s experiment. You will be <br>
asked to study the 48 Spanish-English vocabulary pairs (e.g., CASA- HOUSE) <br>
and then later recall them. Each Spanish word is worth either 1, 3, or 5 points <br>
if you learn what it means and correctly recall the English equivalent on the <br>
upcoming recall test (e.g., CASA - ?).  Your goal is to EARN AS MANY <br>
POINTS AS POSSIBLE.<br>
