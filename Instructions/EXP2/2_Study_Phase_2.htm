Sixteen different grids, each containing 3 Spanish words, will appear <br>
one at a time.  You will have 5 seconds once the grid appears to select and <br>
study all of the items within the grid. Below each word will be a number, which tells you how <br>
many points that word is worth.  To see the English equivalent, simply <br>
click on the Spanish word. Once you finish studying an item, click the “Close” button<br>
in the bottom right of the screen which will bring you back to the grid <br>
and give you the option to (re)select another item. If at any point a <br>
word is not being displayed simply click the "Refresh" button in the <br>
bottom left to reset the screen.<br>
<br>
If you finish studying the items within a grid before time runs out, simply click the <br>
“Continue” button to move on to the next set of items.  Once you have <br>
gone through the sixteen grids you will be asked to complete a final <br>
recall test in which you will be presented with each Spanish word and <br>
asked to type the English equivalent.  Again, your goal is to EARN AS <br>
MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE. <br>
