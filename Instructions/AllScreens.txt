<SCREEN INDEX=1>

In this task you will be asked to study Chinese-English vocabulary pairs.  Before you
begin studying the vocabulary pairs, we would like to know how easy you think each 
Chinese word will be for you to learn.  You will make your ratings using the
following scale:


_________________________________________________________________________________
1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
Easy                                 Medium                                    Hard

If you think the word will be easy for you to learn, then you will select a number on
the left side of the scale.  If you think the word will be hard for you to learn, you
will select a number on the right side of the scale.  If you think the word will be
somewhere between easy and hard, then you will select a number in the middle of the
scale.  You will provide your rating by typing the number that corresponds with your 
selection.  Please click "Continue" to view a sample screen so that you may become
familiar with the format.

Please type a number in the space below to indicate how easy or hard you think the
Chinese word will be for you to learn then click "Continue"

</SCREEN INDEX=2>
<CLICK CONTINUE>
<SCREEN INDEX=3>

Each Chinese word will appear, one at a time, for 3 seconds.  Then a screen will
appear that asks you to provide an ease of learning judgment for that item using
the 1-9 scale that appeared on the previous screen.  This process will continue
until you have  provided an ease of learning judgment for each item.  If you have
questions about this procedure, please notify the experimenter now.  Otherwise,
please click "Continue" to begin providing your judgments.

Now that you have had a chance to preview all the Chinese words, we are going to give
you an opportunity to select Chinese words for which you would like to view the
English equivalent in preparation for a recall test in which you will be presented
with the Chinese words and asked to recall their English counterparts.  Please click 
"Continue".

</SCREEN INDEX=4>
<CLICK CONTINUE>
<SCREEN INDEX=5>

Before you begin studying we would like to know how many of the 18 words you expect
to be able to learn and correctly recall. That is, during the recall test when you
are presented with the Chinese portion of each vocabulary pair, how many of the 18
English equivalents do you expect to be able to correctly recall?  Please type a
number between 0 and 18 below.

Thank you for providing your prediction.  The following screens will provide
instructions for the study phase.  Please click "Continue".

<SCREEN INDEX=7>

In the first study phase you will be given the opportunity to view 3 different 2 x 3
grids and select the Chinese words for which you would like to see the English
equivalents.  Each 2 x 3 grid will contain the Chinese words from Chinese-English
vocabulary pairs.  A sample study grid appears below.  If this grid were active, then
you could click on one of the Chinese characters to view its English equivalent.


<IMAGE "Sample Grid">



Please click "Continue" once you have had a chance to review the sample grid.

</SCREEN INDEX=7>
<CLICK CONTINUE>
<SCREEN INDEX=8>

You will have 60 seconds total to study the items within a grid.  Only by clicking on
a Chinese word will you be able to view the English equivalent for that word.  Once
you select an item to study, a new screen will appear that contains the complete
Chinese-English vocabulary pair as well as a countdown clock indicating how much time
you have left to study items within the grid.  This clock will continue to count down
until you either indicate you are finished studying the item by clicking the 
"Finished studying" button or time runs out.  

Please click "Continue" to view a sample study screen.

<CLICK CONTINUE>
<======== display sample study screen ===============>
<SCREEN INDEX=9>

As noted, clicking on a Chinese word will allow you to see the English equivalent to
the Chinese word.  For example, if you were to click on the Chinese word 

"<insert Chinese character labeled "CHINESESAMPLE">", 

then a new screen would appear
that would contain both the Chinese and English words (e.g., 

"<insert Chinese character labeled "CHINESESAMPLE">- forest").
  
A sample screen appears below.  
Please click "Continue" once you are finished looking at the sample screen.

</SCREEN INDEX=9>
<CLICK CONTINUE>
<SCREEN INDEX=10>

After you indicate you are finished studying the selected vocabulary pair (e.g., by
clicking on the "Finished Studying" button) the countdown clock will stop and the
grid will automatically reappear and you will have the opportunity to select other
items to study.  To allow you to easily keep track of which items you have studied
within a grid, once an item has been selected for study it will turn red while
unselected items will remain green.  You may select unstudied (green) items or
restudy previously selected (red) items as long as time remains on the clock.  If
you have studied all the items within a grid that you wish to study and time still
remains on the clock, you can indicate that you wish to move on to the next grid by
clicking the "Finished studying this grid" button at the bottom of the grid screen.
Clicking this button will  automatically bring up the next grid and restart the
countdown clock.  Once time has elapsed or you indicate you have finished studying
all three grids you will be asked to try and recall the English equivalents for each
of the 18 Chinese words.  

Please click "Continue" to begin the Trial 1 study phase

Now that you have finished the Trial 1 study phase we would like you to know how many
of the 18 words you expect to be able correctly recall.  That is, during the recall
test when you are presented with the Chinese portion of each vocabulary pair, how
many of the 18 English equivalents do you expect to be able to correctly recall?
Please type a number between 0 and 18 below then click "Continue".


</SCREEN INDEX=11>
<CLICK CONTINUE>
<SCREEN INDEX=12>

Now you will be asked to try to recall the vocabulary pairs.  In each screen we will
present the Chinese word from each vocabulary pair and you will be asked to type the
English equivalent.  After you have typed your response please press "Enter" to move
on to the next word.  If you cannot recall the English equivalent you can simply hit
any letter on the keyboard before clicking "Continue".  Please click "Continue" to
begin the recall test.
