Each Chinese word will appear, one at a time, for 3 seconds.  Then a screen will
appear that asks you to provide an ease of learning judgment for that item using
the 1-9 scale that appeared on the previous screen.  This process will continue
until you have  provided an ease of learning judgment for each item.  If you have
questions about this procedure, please notify the experimenter now.<br>

<h2>If you are ready to begin, please click "Begin" to begin providing your judgments.</h2><br>
