You are now ready to begin the Spanish portion of today’s experiment.<br>  
In this experiment you will be asked to study 48 Spanish-English <br>
vocabulary pairs (e.g., CASA- HOUSE) and then later recall them. <br>
Each Spanish word is worth either 1, 3, or 5 points if you learn what <br>
it means and correctly recall the English equivalent on the upcoming <br>
recall test (e.g., CASA - ?).  Your goal is to EARN AS MANY POINTS <br>
AS POSSIBLE.
