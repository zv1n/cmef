Sixteen different grids, each containing 3 Spanish words, will <br>
appear one at a time.  Above each word will be a number, which <br>
tells you how many points that word it worth.  To see the English <br>
equivalent, simply click on the question mark beneath the Spanish <br>
word. You may study the items as long as you would like.  Once <br>
you finish studying an item, click the “Done studying this item” <br>
button, which will give you the option to (re)select another item.  <br>
<br>
Once you finish studying the items within a grid, simply click the <br>
“Next Grid” button to move on to the next set of items.  Once you <br>
have gone through the sixteen grids you will be asked to complete <br>
a final recall test in which you will be presented with each <br>
Spanish word and asked to type the English equivalent.  Again, <br>
your goal is to EARN AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE. <br>
