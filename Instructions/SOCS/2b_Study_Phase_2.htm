Sixteen different grids, each containing 3 Spanish words, will <br>
appear one at a time.  You will have 5 seconds total per grid to <br>
select and study all the items within the grid.  The 5 seconds <br>
will begin when the grid first appears.  Above each Spanish word <br>
will be a number, which tells you how many points that word it <br>
worth.  To see the English equivalent, simply click on the <br>
question mark beneath the Spanish word. Once you finish studying <br> 
an item, click the “Done studying this item” button, which will <br>
give you the option to (re)select another item if time still <br>
remains.  
<br>
If you finish studying the items within a grid before <br>
time elapses, simply click the “Next Grid” button to move on to <br>
the next set of items.  Once you have gone through the sixteen <br>
grids you will be asked to complete a final recall test in which <br>
you will be presented with each Spanish word and asked to type <br>
the English equivalent.  Again, your goal is to EARN AS MANY <br>
POINTS AS POSSIBLE. Please click "Continue". <br>
