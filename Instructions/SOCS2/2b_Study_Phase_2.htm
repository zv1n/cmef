Sixteen different grids, each containing 3 Spanish words, will appear <br>
one at a time.  You will have 5 seconds total per grid to select <br>
and study all the items within the grid.  The 5 seconds will begin once <br>
you select the first word to study.  Below each word will be a <br>
number, which tells you how many points that word is worth.  To see <br>
the English equivalent, simply click on the Spanish word. Once you <br>
finish studying an item, click the “Close” button in the bottom right <br>
of the screen which will bring you back to the grid and give you the <br>
option to (re)select another item if time still remains. If at any <br>
point a word is not being displayed simply click the "Refresh" button <br>
in the bottom left to reset the screen.<br> 
<br>
If you finish studying the items within a grid before time elapses, <br>
simply click the “Continue” button to move on to the next set of items. <br> 
Once you have gone through the sixteen grids you will be asked to <br>
complete a final recall test in which you will be presented with each <br>
Spanish word and asked to type the English equivalent.  Again, your goal <br>
is to EARN AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE. <br>
