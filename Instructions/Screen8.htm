You will have 60 seconds total to study the items within a grid.  Only by clicking on
a Chinese word will you be able to view the English equivalent for that word.  Once
you select an item to study, a new screen will appear that contains the complete
Chinese-English vocabulary pair as well as a count down clock indicating how much time
you have left to study items within the grid.  This clock will continue to count down
until you either indicate you are finished studying the item by clicking the 
"Finished studying" button or time runs out.<br>
