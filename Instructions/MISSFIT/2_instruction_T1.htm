After you study each word, you will be asked to estimate how likely you will be to remember <br>
the word on a later recall test using a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no confidence and <br>
100 = complete confidence that you will be able to recall the word.<br>
<br>
For example, you may be presented with a word such as "paperclip" and then, after <br>
5 seconds of study time asked, "On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you to remember the <br>
word on the upcoming recall test?" You will be asked to type <br>
ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 to indicate your confidence level. Later, on the recall task you will be given three minutes to type all the words you can recall from the study phase.<br>

<br>
There will be two trials each containing 60 words. At the end of each trial<br>
you will be given a recall test.<br>
<br>

assistant. If you are ready to begin then please click on the word "continue" at the bottom of the<br>
