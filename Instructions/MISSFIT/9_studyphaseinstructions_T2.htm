We will now begin the Trial 2 study phase. As in Trial 1 you will be asked to study <br>
60 new word pairs, each for 5 seconds. After you study each word pair you will be asked <br>
to predict how likely you will be to remember the word pair on the Trial 2 recall test. <br>
Remember that you can type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100. Typing 0 means there is no likelihood <br>
that you will recall the second word when presented with the first, and 100 means you will <br>
definitely recall the word pair on the Trial 2 recall test.<br><br>
