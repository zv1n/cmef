Now that you have completed the study phase for Trial 2, you are ready to begin the Trial 2 <br>
recall test. Once you begin the test you will have 3 minutes to type all the words you can <br>
remember from Trial 2.  As you did before, please type one word and then hit continue before<br>
typing the next word.  You should try to continue recalling as many words as possible until<br>
either time elapses or you can't remember any more words. <br><br>


If you have questions please quietly notify the experimenter now. Otherwise, please click "Continue" to <br> begin the recall test.<br><br>
