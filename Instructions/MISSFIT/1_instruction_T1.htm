In this task you will be asked to try to remember words presented in different fonts.<br>
Some words represent large items (e.g., building), while other words represent <br>
smaller items that are small enough to fit in a shoebox (e.g., paperclip). The <br>
words will either be presented in large 48 point font or small 18 point font. Thus, <br>
in some cases you will study large items presented in large fonts, small items presented <br>
in small fonts, or the size of the items and fonts will be mismatched (e.g., small items <br>
will be presented in large font). <br> <br>

To advance to the next screen, please click on the word "continue" at the bottom of the<br> 
screen; however, be sure to read the instruction screens thoroughly before continuing<br>
because you will be unable to go back. <br>
