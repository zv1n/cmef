We will now begin the study phase of trial 1. Once you click continue below, you will<br>
be presented with 60 word pairs. Each pair will be presented for 5 seconds and then you<br>
will be asked to predict how likely you will be able to remember the word pair<br>
on a later recall test. The scale will be presented from 0 (no likelihood of recall) to<br>
100 (likelihood of recall is certain).<br>
Please click continue to begin the study phase of trial 1.<br>
