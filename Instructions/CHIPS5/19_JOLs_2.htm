Now that you have had an opportunity to restudy half of the word pairs <br>
we would like to know how likely you think you will be able to correctly <br>
recall each of the 36 characters on a recall test. <br><br>

Once again you will be presented with each of the Chinese characters and <br>
asked to predict on a scale of 0% to 100% how likely you think you will <br>
be able to correctly recall the character on a recall test (with 0% meaning <br>
you think there is no chance of recalling the English equivilent and  <br>
100% meaning you are 100 percent sure that you will be able to recall<br>
the English equivilent).  Please hit "Continue" to begin. <br>
